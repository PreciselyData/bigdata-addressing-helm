# Download and Upload Docker Images to AWS ECR

## Description

The geo-addressing-spark helm chart relies on the availability of Docker images for running spark jobs, all of
which are conveniently obtainable from Precisely Data Experience. The required docker images include:

1. Geo Addressing Big Data Docker Image

> [!NOTE]: 
> Contact Precisely for buying subscription to docker image

Once you have purchased a subscription to Precisely Data Experience (PDX), you can directly download Docker images.
Afterward, you can easily load these Docker images into your Docker environment.

This repository includes a script that facilitates the download of Docker image zips from PDX and their
subsequent upload to AWS ECR, or you can run the commands to upload the docker images to ECR manually.

Please note that this project assumes the presence of Python, Docker, and awscli on your system.

### Step 1 - Install Requirements

Run the following command to install requirements:

```console
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Script for Uploading to ECR

The following command downloads the docker images from PDX and uploads it to your Elastic Container Registry.

> [!NOTE]:
> You need to have docker running locally for this script to work.
>

```console
python upload_ecr.py --pdx-api-key [pdx-api-key] --pdx-api-secret [pdx-secret] --aws-access-key [aws-access-key] --aws-secret [aws-secret] --aws-region [aws-region]
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Manually push the docker images to ECR

Run the following commands for EACH docker image in the zip file:

```shell
aws ecr get-login-password --region [REGION] | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin [AWS-ACCOUNT-ID].dkr.ecr.[REGION].amazonaws.com
docker load -i ./geo-addressing-spark-on-k8s.tar
docker tag geo-addressing-spark-on-k8s:latest [AWS-ACCOUNT-ID].dkr.ecr.[REGION].amazonaws.com/geo-addressing-spark-on-k8s:0.1.0
docker push [AWS-ACCOUNT-ID].dkr.ecr.[REGION].amazonaws.com/geo-addressing-spark-on-k8s:0.1.0
```
